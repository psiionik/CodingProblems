/* 
Your project team is collaborating with a group of software testers who have requested an array 
generator service to assist in testing software functionality.

Problem Statement
The service takes the following input parameters:

- arr: An array of n positive integers.
- state: A string of n characters, where:
    '1' indicates that the corresponding arr[i] is available for selection.
    '0' indicates that arr[i] is blocked initially.
- m: The number of operations to perform.


Operations
To create an integer array S, the following operation is performed exactly m times. S is initially empty.
- Choose any available arr[i] (where state[i] = '1'). The same element can be chosen multiple times.
- Append the selected arr[i] to S.
- For all state[i] = '0' such that state[i-1] = '1', change state[i] to '1'.
    For example if state = '0100101' before the operation it equals
    state = '0110111' after the operation.

Note: A sequence x of length m is lexicographically larger than a sequence y of length m if there exists such
i(0 <= i <= m) that x[i] > y[i] and for any j(0 <= j <= i) x[j] = x[i]

Objective
Find the lexicographically largest sequence S that can be obtained after exactly m operations.

Example:
Input: arr = [5,3,4,6], state = "1100", m = 5
Output = [5, 5, 6, 6, 6]
